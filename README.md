**Bits-coins-ia** is not just a trading bot; it is a **Multiversal Reality Bridge** designed to synthesize complex financial data into actionable, value-driven intelligence. By blending immersive 3D spatial environments with a brutalist, high-frequency execution layer, it empowers users to navigate the singularity of modern markets.

## 🪐 Universe Overview
Bits-coins-ia is a living system with four interlocked dimensions. Each dimension operates independently, but the full experience emerges when they are synchronized:

1. **The Spatial Plane (Frontend Multiverse)**  
   A next-generation interface that renders market reality as a 3D system. It is optimized for high-velocity perception and fast decisions.

2. **The Cognitive Plane (Agent Core)**  
   A swarm of autonomous agents that reason, measure ROI, and validate decisions before execution.

3. **The Temporal Plane (Execution + Metrics)**  
   Where latency, throughput, and time-saved are measured continuously to preserve the integrity of the system.

4. **The Memory Plane (Persistence)**  
   A persistent store of decisions, metrics, and research used to refine strategy over time.

## 🚀 Vision & Philosophy

In an era of information entropy, **Bits-coins-ia** provides a stabilized lens through which to observe and interact with financial reality. Our architecture is built on three pillars:

1.  **Value-Driven Intelligence**: We don't just track data; we measure the REAL impact and time saved by autonomous decisions.
2.  **Immersive Observation**: Market volatility is materialized as physical phenomena (R3F), allowing for intuitive pattern recognition.
3.  **Brutalist Precision**: When it's time to execute, every millisecond counts. Our "Bunker Mode" offers zero-latency operational focus.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack

### High-Fidelity Frontend (`apps/web-spatial`)
- **Next.js 15 (App Router)**: The backbone of our spatial web architecture.
- **React Three Fiber (R3F)**: Powering the generative 3D multiverse.
- **Tailwind CSS & Framer Motion**: Ensuring a premium, fluid aesthetic.
- **Zustand**: Managing multi-universe state synchronization.

### Autonomous Backend (`packages/core-agents`)
- **FastAPI**: A high-performance, asynchronous bridge between agents.
- **Agent Swarm**: Specialized units for Research, Quant analysis, and Market sensor reading.
- **Reality Tracker**: A persistent metrics layer validating ROI and prediction accuracy in real-time.
- **SQLAlchemy (Async)**: Robust persistence for decision histories.

## 💎 Features

### 1. The Reality Dashboard
Track real-time ROI, time saved, and prediction accuracy. Our "Value Proof" system ensures that every decision made by the AI is measurable and auditable.

### 2. Autonomous Oracle
A continuous market scanner that analyzes tickers (BTC, ETH, SOL) using multi-dimensional research and quantitative modeling, automatically generating validated decisions.

### 3. Unified Agent Protocol (UAV)
Every decision is validated through a rigorous mathematical and physical protocol, ensuring that the machine's "reasoning" is sound before execution.

## 🧭 Navigation Guide (Universe Quickstart)
If you want to experience the platform as a full “universe”:
1. Start the **frontend** and observe the **Spatial Plane**.  
2. Start the **backend** and activate the **Cognitive Plane**.  
3. Watch the **Temporal Plane** metrics update in real time.  
4. Review persisted decisions to see the **Memory Plane** improve accuracy.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- Python (3.12+)
- Git

### Installation
